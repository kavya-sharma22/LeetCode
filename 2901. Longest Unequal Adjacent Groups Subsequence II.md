# Problem: 2901. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence II

## Difficulty: Medium

---

## Problem Description

You are given a string array `words`, and an array `groups`, both of the same length `n`.

* The **hamming distance** between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.

### Goal:

Select the **longest subsequence** from the array of indices `[0, 1, ..., n - 1]` such that for every pair of **adjacent indices** `[i0, i1, ..., ik-1]`, the following conditions hold:

1. `groups[ij] != groups[ij+1]` (the group values must differ for adjacent elements).
2. `words[ij]` and `words[ij+1]` must:

   * Be of **equal length**.
   * Have a **hamming distance of exactly 1**.

Return the list of words from the selected longest subsequence.
If multiple such subsequences exist, return any of them.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```java
words = ["bab","dab","cab"]
groups = [1,2,2]
```

**Output:**

```java
["bab","cab"]
```

**Explanation:**

* Possible valid subsequences: \["bab","cab"] or \["bab","dab"]
* Both have hamming distance 1 and different groups.
* Longest length is 2.

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```java
words = ["a","b","c","d"]
groups = [1,2,3,4]
```

**Output:**

```java
["a","b","c","d"]
```

**Explanation:**

* All strings have length 1.
* All are in different groups.
* Hamming distance between any two distinct 1-letter words is 1.
* Longest valid subsequence is length 4.

---

## Constraints:

* `1 <= n == words.length == groups.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
* `1 <= groups[i] <= n`
* All elements in `words` are **distinct**
* All characters in `words[i]` are **lowercase English letters**

---

## Solution Explanation

The algorithm uses **Dynamic Programming** to find the longest subsequence satisfying the constraints.

### Approach:

1. Initialize two arrays:

   * `dp[i]`: stores the length of the longest valid subsequence ending at index `i`.
   * `prev[i]`: stores the previous index in the valid sequence for reconstruction.
2. Loop over all index pairs `(j, i)` where `j < i`, and:

   * Check if `words[i]` and `words[j]` are of the same length.
   * Check if their hamming distance is exactly 1.
   * Ensure that `groups[i] != groups[j]`.
   * If all conditions hold and `dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]`, update `dp[i]` and `prev[i]`.
3. Find the maximum value in `dp[]` and backtrack using `prev[]` to construct the sequence.

### Hamming Distance Check:

Implemented using a helper method `check(s1, s2)` that returns true if the hamming distance is exactly 1.

## Java Code

```java
class Solution {

    public List<String> getWordsInLongestSubsequence(
        String[] words,
        int[] groups
    ) {
        int n = groups.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        int[] prev = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        Arrays.fill(prev, -1);
        int maxIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (
                    check(words[i], words[j]) &&
                    dp[j] + 1 > dp[i] &&
                    groups[i] != groups[j]
                ) {
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
                    prev[i] = j;
                }
            }
            if (dp[i] > dp[maxIndex]) {
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = maxIndex; i >= 0; i = prev[i]) {
            ans.add(words[i]);
        }
        Collections.reverse(ans);
        return ans;
    }

    private boolean check(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
            if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) {
                if (++diff > 1) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return diff == 1;
    }
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2 * L)` where `L` is the average word length (up to 10)
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for `dp` and `prev` arrays
