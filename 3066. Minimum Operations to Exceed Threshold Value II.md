# Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you will:
- Take the two smallest integers `x` and `y` in `nums`.
- Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.
- Add `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)` anywhere in the array.

Note that you can only apply the described operation if `nums` contains at least two elements.

Return the minimum number of operations needed so that all elements of the array are greater than or equal to `k`.

## Example 1:

**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [2,11,10,1,3], k = 10
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
2
```

**Explanation:**
1. Remove `1` and `2`, then add `1 * 2 + 2 = 4` to `nums`.
   - `nums` becomes `[4, 11, 10, 3]`.
2. Remove `3` and `4`, then add `3 * 2 + 4 = 10` to `nums`.
   - `nums` becomes `[10, 11, 10]`.
   - All elements are now `>= k`, so we stop.

The minimum number of operations required is **2**.

## Example 2:

**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [1,1,2,4,9], k = 20
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
4
```

**Explanation:**
1. Remove `1` and `1`, add `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` â†’ `nums = [2, 4, 9, 3]`.
2. Remove `2` and `3`, add `2 * 2 + 3 = 7` â†’ `nums = [7, 4, 9]`.
3. Remove `4` and `7`, add `4 * 2 + 7 = 15` â†’ `nums = [15, 9]`.
4. Remove `9` and `15`, add `9 * 2 + 15 = 33` â†’ `nums = [33]`.
   - All elements are now `>= k`, so we stop.

The minimum number of operations required is **4**.

## Solution Approach

### Algorithm
1. **Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue)** to always fetch the smallest two elements efficiently.
2. **Perform Operations:**
   - Extract the two smallest elements `x` and `y`.
   - Compute the new value: `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)`.
   - Insert this new value back into the heap.
   - Increment operation count.
3. **Repeat Until All Elements are `>= k`**.

### Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Long> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<Long>(
            Arrays.stream(nums)
                .mapToLong(i -> (long) i)
                .boxed()
                .collect(Collectors.toList())
        );
        int numOperations = 0;

        while (minHeap.peek() < k) {
            long x = minHeap.remove();
            long y = minHeap.remove();
            minHeap.add(Math.min(x, y) * 2 + Math.max(x, y));

            numOperations++;
        }
        return numOperations;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Heap Operations:** Extracting two elements and inserting one element takes `O(log n)`, so each operation runs in `O(log n)`.
- **Overall Complexity:** The worst case runs `O(n log n)` as we process all elements.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the priority queue.

---

## Summary
- We use a **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)** to efficiently fetch the smallest values.
- The problem is solved in **O(n log n) time** with efficient heap operations.
- This approach ensures we find the **minimum number of operations** to make all numbers `>= k`.
