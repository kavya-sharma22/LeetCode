# House Robber IV

## Problem Statement
The problem involves a series of consecutive houses, each containing some amount of money. A robber wants to steal from these houses but cannot rob adjacent houses. The objective is to determine the minimum capability of the robber, defined as the maximum amount of money stolen from a single house, while ensuring that at least `k` houses are robbed.

## Solution Approach
The solution employs a **binary search** approach to determine the minimum capability required to rob at least `k` houses while maintaining the non-adjacent constraint. The key steps include:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - Set `minReward` to `1` (smallest possible house value).
   - Set `maxReward` to the maximum value in `nums`.

2. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - Compute `midReward` as the middle value between `minReward` and `maxReward`.
   - Iterate through `nums`, counting how many houses can be robbed without violating the non-adjacency condition.
   - If at least `k` houses can be robbed with `midReward` capability, reduce `maxReward`.
   - Otherwise, increase `minReward`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - The final `minReward` value is the minimum capability required to rob at least `k` houses.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The binary search operates on the range `[1, max(nums)]`, leading to `O(log max(nums))` iterations.
- Each iteration involves a linear scan (`O(n)`) through `nums` to determine the number of houses that can be robbed.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n log max(nums))**.

### Space Complexity
- The algorithm operates in **O(1)** extra space since only a few integer variables are used for tracking search boundaries and counters.

## Example Usage

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCapability(int[] nums, int k) {
        int minReward = 1;
        int maxReward = Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt();
        int totalHouses = nums.length;

        while (minReward < maxReward) {
            int midReward = (minReward + maxReward) / 2;
            int possibleThefts = 0;

            for (int index = 0; index < totalHouses; ++index) {
                if (nums[index] <= midReward) {
                    possibleThefts += 1;
                    index++; // Skip next house to maintain non-adjacency
                }
            }

            if (possibleThefts >= k) maxReward = midReward;
            else minReward = midReward + 1;
        }

        return minReward;
    }
}
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= (nums.length + 1) / 2`

## Summary
This solution efficiently finds the minimum capability using binary search combined with a greedy counting strategy. The **O(n log max(nums))** complexity ensures it runs efficiently for large inputs, making it well-suited for competitive programming and real-world applications.
