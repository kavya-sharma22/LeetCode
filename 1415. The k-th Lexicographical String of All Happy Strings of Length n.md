# The k-th Lexicographical Happy String (LeetCode 1415)  

## Problem Statement  
A **happy string** is a string that:  
- Consists only of letters from the set `['a', 'b', 'c']`.  
- Has no two adjacent characters that are the same (`s[i] != s[i + 1]`).  

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the `k-th` lexicographical happy string of length `n`. If there are fewer than `k` happy strings, return an empty string.  

---

## Examples  

### Example 1  
**Input:**  
```java
n = 1, k = 3
```
**Output:**  
```java
"c"
```
**Explanation:**  
The happy strings of length 1: `["a", "b", "c"]`.  
The 3rd string is `"c"`.  

---

### Example 2  
**Input:**  
```java
n = 1, k = 4
```
**Output:**  
```java
""
```
**Explanation:**  
There are only **3** happy strings of length 1.  

---

### Example 3  
**Input:**  
```java
n = 3, k = 9
```
**Output:**  
```java
"cab"
```
**Explanation:**  
The happy strings of length 3 in lexicographical order:  
```
["aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", "bab", "bac", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbc"]
```
The 9th string is **"cab"**.  

---

## Constraints  
- `1 <= n <= 10`  
- `1 <= k <= total happy strings of length n`  

---

## Solution Approach  

The problem is solved using **backtracking** to generate all possible happy strings:  

1. **Recursively build valid happy strings**, ensuring no two adjacent characters are the same.  
2. **Store generated happy strings in a list** and sort them lexicographically.  
3. **If `k` is within range**, return the `k-th` string; otherwise, return an empty string.  

---

## Implementation (Java)  

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    List<String> happyStrings = new ArrayList<>();

    public String getHappyString(int n, int k) {
        String currentString = "";
        generateHappyStrings(n, currentString);

        if (happyStrings.size() < k) return "";

        Collections.sort(happyStrings);
        return happyStrings.get(k - 1);
    }

    protected void generateHappyStrings(int n, String currentString) {
        if (currentString.length() == n) {
            happyStrings.add(currentString);
            return;
        }

        for (char currentChar = 'a'; currentChar <= 'c'; currentChar++) {
            if (currentString.length() > 0 &&
                currentString.charAt(currentString.length() - 1) == currentChar)
                continue;

            generateHappyStrings(n, currentString + currentChar);
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis  
- **Generating happy strings**: `O(2^n)`, since each character has 2 valid choices except for the first character.  
- **Sorting the list**: `O(m log m)`, where `m` is the number of happy strings.  
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(2^n + m log m)`.
