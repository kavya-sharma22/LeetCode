#### Maximum Number of Points From Grid Queries

## Problem Description
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an array `queries` of size `k`.

Find an array `answer` of size `k` such that for each integer `queries[i]`, you start in the top-left cell of the matrix and repeat the following process:

1. If `queries[i]` is strictly greater than the value of the current cell that you are in, then you get one point if it is your first time visiting this cell, and you can move to any adjacent cell in all 4 directions: up, down, left, and right.
2. Otherwise, you do not get any points, and you end this process.
3. After the process, `answer[i]` is the maximum number of points you can get. Note that for each query you are allowed to visit the same cell multiple times.

Return the resulting array `answer`.

## Example

### Example 1
#### Input:
```java
grid = [[1,2,3],[2,5,7],[3,5,1]]
queries = [5,6,2]
```
#### Output:
```java
[5,8,1]
```
#### Explanation:
The diagrams above show which cells we visit to get points for each query.

---

### Example 2
#### Input:
```java
grid = [[5,2,1],[1,1,2]]
queries = [3]
```
#### Output:
```java
[0]
```
#### Explanation:
We cannot get any points because the value of the top-left cell is already greater than or equal to 3.

## Constraints
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `2 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `4 <= m * n <= 10^5`
- `k == queries.length`
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`
- `1 <= grid[i][j], queries[i] <= 10^6`

---

## Solution Approach
- We use a **priority queue (min-heap)** to process cells in increasing order of value.
- We process **queries in sorted order** to efficiently compute the results.
- A **boolean matrix** keeps track of visited cells.
- We move in **four directions (up, down, left, right)** while ensuring we stay within bounds.
- The final results are stored and returned in the order of the queries.

## Java Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] maxPoints(int[][] grid, int[] queries) {
        int rowCount = grid.length, colCount = grid[0].length;
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        int[][] DIRECTIONS = { { 0, 1 }, { 1, 0 }, { 0, -1 }, { -1, 0 } };

        int[][] sortedQueries = new int[queries.length][2];
        for (int index = 0; index < queries.length; index++) {
            sortedQueries[index][0] = queries[index];
            sortedQueries[index][1] = index;
        }
        Arrays.sort(sortedQueries, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        PriorityQueue<int[]> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rowCount][colCount];
        int totalPoints = 0;

        minHeap.add(new int[] { grid[0][0], 0, 0 });
        visited[0][0] = true;

        for (int[] query : sortedQueries) {
            int queryValue = query[0], queryIndex = query[1];
            while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.peek()[0] < queryValue) {
                int[] top = minHeap.poll();
                int cellValue = top[0], currentRow = top[1], currentCol = top[2];
                totalPoints++;

                for (int[] dir : DIRECTIONS) {
                    int newRow = currentRow + dir[0], newCol = currentCol + dir[1];
                    if (
                        newRow >= 0 &&
                        newCol >= 0 &&
                        newRow < rowCount &&
                        newCol < colCount &&
                        !visited[newRow][newCol]
                    ) {
                        minHeap.add(
                            new int[] { grid[newRow][newCol], newRow, newCol }
                        );
                        visited[newRow][newCol] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            result[queryIndex] = totalPoints;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Sorting Queries**: `O(k log k)`
- **Heap Operations**: `O(m * n log (m * n))`
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(k log k + m * n log (m * n))`

---

## Explanation
- The **priority queue** ensures that we expand the grid cells in order of their values.
- **Sorting queries** helps in efficiently computing the results for all values.
- The **visited matrix** prevents unnecessary recomputation.
- This approach ensures optimal performance given the constraints.

---

## ðŸš€ Optimizations
- Instead of using a `PriorityQueue`, **Union-Find** can be explored to optimize further.
- **Binary search** on queries could reduce sorting overhead.
- **Precomputing valid paths** could help in some cases.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Summary
- **Heap-based approach** efficiently expands grid cells in increasing order.
- **Sorting queries** allows for efficient traversal.
- **Four-directional movement** ensures proper exploration.
- **Optimal complexity** makes it suitable for large constraints.
