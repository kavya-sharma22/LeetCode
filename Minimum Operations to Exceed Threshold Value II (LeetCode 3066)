Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II (LeetCode 3066)
Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Perform the following operation on nums until all elements in the array are greater than or equal to k:

Take the two smallest integers x and y from the array.
Remove x and y from the array.
Add min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y) to the array.
Repeat this operation until all elements in nums are greater than or equal to k. Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve this.

Example 1:
Input:
      nums = [2, 11, 10, 1, 3], k = 10
Output:
      2
