# Distinct Colors Among Balls

## Problem Overview

This repository contains a solution to the problem **"Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls"**. The problem is about keeping track of distinct colors on a set of balls after each coloring query.

You are given a set of `limit + 1` balls labeled from `0` to `limit`. Initially, all balls are uncolored. For each query, a ball is colored with a new color, and after each operation, the number of distinct colors is determined. The goal is to return an array where each entry at index `i` represents the number of distinct colors after the `i`-th query.

## Problem Description

Given an integer `limit` and a 2D array `queries` of size `n x 2`:

- There are `limit + 1` balls with distinct labels in the range `[0, limit]`. Initially, all balls are uncolored.
- For each query `[x, y]`, ball `x` is marked with color `y`.
- After each query, you need to find and record the number of distinct colors among the balls.
