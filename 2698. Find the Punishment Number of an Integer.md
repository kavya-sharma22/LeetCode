# Punishment Number Calculation

## Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, return the punishment number of `n`.

The **punishment number** of `n` is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers `i` such that:
- `1 <= i <= n`
- The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`.

### Example 1:
#### Input:
```plaintext
n = 10
```
#### Output:
```plaintext
182
```
#### Explanation:
There are exactly 3 integers `i` in the range `[1, 10]` that satisfy the conditions:
- `1` since `1 * 1 = 1`
- `9` since `9 * 9 = 81` and `81` can be partitioned into `8` and `1` with a sum equal to `8 + 1 == 9`.
- `10` since `10 * 10 = 100` and `100` can be partitioned into `10` and `0` with a sum equal to `10 + 0 == 10`.

Hence, the punishment number of `10` is `1 + 81 + 100 = 182`.

### Example 2:
#### Input:
```plaintext
n = 37
```
#### Output:
```plaintext
1478
```
#### Explanation:
There are exactly 4 integers `i` in the range `[1, 37]` that satisfy the conditions:
- `1` since `1 * 1 = 1`
- `9` since `9 * 9 = 81` and `81` can be partitioned into `8 + 1`.
- `10` since `10 * 10 = 100` and `100` can be partitioned into `10 + 0`.
- `36` since `36 * 36 = 1296` and `1296` can be partitioned into `1 + 29 + 6`.

Hence, the punishment number of `37` is `1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478`.

## Solution Approach
The solution follows these steps:
1. **Iterate over numbers from `1` to `n`**: For each number `i`, compute its square.
2. **Check partitioning condition**: Convert the square to a string and recursively check if it can be partitioned into contiguous substrings whose sum equals `i`.
3. **Use memoization**: Store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
4. **Sum up valid squares**: If a number satisfies the partitioning condition, add its square to the total punishment number.

### Code Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean findPartitions(
        int startIndex,
        int sum,
        String stringNum,
        int target,
        int[][] memo
    ) {
        if (startIndex == stringNum.length()) {
            return sum == target;
        }
        if (sum > target) return false;
        if (memo[startIndex][sum] != -1) return memo[startIndex][sum] == 1;
        boolean partitionFound = false;
        for (int currentIndex = startIndex; currentIndex < stringNum.length(); currentIndex++) {
            String currentString = stringNum.substring(startIndex, currentIndex + 1);
            int addend = Integer.parseInt(currentString);
            partitionFound = partitionFound || findPartitions(currentIndex + 1, sum + addend, stringNum, target, memo);
            if (partitionFound) {
                memo[startIndex][sum] = 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        memo[startIndex][sum] = 0;
        return false;
    }

    public int punishmentNumber(int n) {
        int punishmentNum = 0;
        for (int currentNum = 1; currentNum <= n; currentNum++) {
            int squareNum = currentNum * currentNum;
            String stringNum = Integer.toString(squareNum);
            int[][] memoArray = new int[stringNum.length()][currentNum + 1];
            for (int[] row : memoArray) {
                java.util.Arrays.fill(row, -1);
            }
            if (findPartitions(0, 0, stringNum, currentNum, memoArray)) {
                punishmentNum += squareNum;
            }
        }
        return punishmentNum;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
Let `n` be the input value.
- **Outer Loop Complexity**: The function iterates through numbers from `1` to `n`, making it **O(n)**.
- **Recursive Partitioning Check**: For each number `i`, we check if `i^2` can be split into valid partitions. The worst-case scenario explores all possible ways to split a number with `d` digits, leading to an exponential complexity **O(2^d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in `i^2`.
- **Memoization Optimization**: Helps reduce redundant calculations, making the practical runtime lower than naive brute-force approaches.

### Overall Time Complexity
- The worst case occurs when handling numbers with large squares (i.e., `n^2` has many digits), leading to an approximate **O(n * 2^d)** complexity.
- Since `d = O(log(n^2)) = O(2 log n)`, the time complexity can be expressed as **O(n * 2^(2 log n))**, which is impractical for very large `n`, but manageable for `n â‰¤ 1000`.
