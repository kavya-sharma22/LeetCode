# LeetCode 1092: Shortest Common Supersequence

## Problem Statement
Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences. If there are multiple valid strings, return any of them.

A string `s` is a subsequence of string `t` if deleting some number of characters from `t` (possibly 0) results in the string `s`.

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`str1 = "abac"`, `str2 = "cab"`  

**Output:**  
`"cabac"`  

**Explanation:**  
- `str1 = "abac"` is a subsequence of `"cabac"` because we can delete the first `"c"`.
- `str2 = "cab"` is a subsequence of `"cabac"` because we can delete the last `"ac"`.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`str1 = "aaaaaaaa"`, `str2 = "aaaaaaaa"`  

**Output:**  
`"aaaaaaaa"`  

## Constraints
- 1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
- str1 and str2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Approach
The problem is solved using **Dynamic Programming**. We maintain a **DP table** where `dp[i][j]` stores the shortest common supersequence (SCS) of `str1[0..i-1]` and `str2[0..j-1]`. Instead of a 2D table, we optimize space by using two rows (previous and current) during iteration.

- If the characters match, they contribute to the supersequence.
- If they don't match, we consider both options: skipping a character from `str1` or from `str2`, and choose the shorter resulting sequence.

This solution achieves **O(n * m)** time complexity and **O(m)** space complexity, where `n` is the length of `str1` and `m` is the length of `str2`.

### Java Code

```java
class Solution {

    public String shortestCommonSupersequence(String str1, String str2) {
        int str1Length = str1.length();
        int str2Length = str2.length();

        // Initialize the first row (when str1 is empty, the supersequence is str2's prefix)
        String[] prevRow = new String[str2Length + 1];
        for (int col = 0; col <= str2Length; col++) {
            prevRow[col] = str2.substring(0, col);
        }

        // Fill the DP table row by row
        for (int row = 1; row <= str1Length; row++) {
            // Initialize the first column (when str2 is empty, the supersequence is str1's prefix)
            String[] currRow = new String[str2Length + 1];
            currRow[0] = str1.substring(0, row);

            for (int col = 1; col <= str2Length; col++) {
                // If characters match, extend the supersequence from the diagonal value
                if (str1.charAt(row - 1) == str2.charAt(col - 1)) {
                    currRow[col] = prevRow[col - 1] + str1.charAt(row - 1);
                } else {
                    // If characters do not match, choose the shorter supersequence
                    // From previous row (exclude current str1 char)
                    String pickS1 = prevRow[col];
                    // From previous column (exclude current str2 char)
                    String pickS2 = currRow[col - 1];

                    currRow[col] = (pickS1.length() < pickS2.length())
                        ? pickS1 + str1.charAt(row - 1)
                        : pickS2 + str2.charAt(col - 1);
                }
            }
            // Move to the next row (update previous row reference)
            prevRow = currRow;
        }

        // Return the shortest common supersequence from the last cell
        return prevRow[str2Length];
    }
}
```

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-1092-shortest-common-supersequence.git
    cd leetcode-1092-shortest-common-supersequence
    ```

2. Compile and Run:
    ```sh
    javac Solution.java
    java Solution
    ```

### Time Complexity
- **Time:** O(n * m)  
- **Space:** O(m)

Where `n` is the length of `str1` and `m` is the length of `str2`.
