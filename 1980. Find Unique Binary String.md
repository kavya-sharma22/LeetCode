# The k-th Lexicographical Happy String

## Problem Statement
A **happy string** is a string that:
- Consists only of letters from the set `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
- Has no two adjacent characters that are the same.

Given two integers `n` and `k`, generate a list of all happy strings of length `n` sorted in **lexicographical order**. Return the `k-th` string from this list, or return an **empty string** if there are fewer than `k` happy strings.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
n = 1, k = 3
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
"c"
```
**Explanation:** The list `['a', 'b', 'c']` contains all happy strings of length `1`. The third string is `"c"`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
n = 1, k = 4
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
""
```
**Explanation:** There are only 3 happy strings of length `1`.

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```plaintext
n = 3, k = 9
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
"cab"
```
**Explanation:** The list of happy strings of length `3` is:
`["aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", "bab", "bac", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbc"]`.
The 9th string is `"cab"`.

## Solution Approach
The solution follows a **backtracking approach**:
1. **Generate all happy strings of length `n`** recursively.
2. **Ensure that no two consecutive characters are the same**.
3. **Sort the generated happy strings** in lexicographical order.
4. **Return the `k-th` string** from the sorted list, or return an empty string if `k` is out of range.

### Implementation (Java)
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    List<String> happyStrings = new ArrayList<>();

    public String getHappyString(int n, int k) {
        String currentString = "";
        generateHappyStrings(n, currentString);
        
        if (happyStrings.size() < k) return "";
        Collections.sort(happyStrings);
        return happyStrings.get(k - 1);
    }

    protected void generateHappyStrings(int n, String currentString) {
        if (currentString.length() == n) {
            happyStrings.add(currentString);
            return;
        }

        for (char currentChar = 'a'; currentChar <= 'c'; currentChar++) {
            if (currentString.length() > 0 &&
                currentString.charAt(currentString.length() - 1) == currentChar) continue;
            
            generateHappyStrings(n, currentString + currentChar);
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Generating all happy strings:** Since we have 3 choices (`a, b, c`) for the first character and 2 choices for subsequent characters (to avoid repetition), the total number of happy strings of length `n` is **O(2^(n-1))**.
- **Sorting the happy strings:** The sorting step takes **O(m log m)**, where `m` is the number of happy strings.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(2^n + m log m)`, which is feasible for `n ≤ 10`.

## Edge Cases Considered
- **`k` is larger than the number of happy strings** → Return an empty string `""`.
- **`n = 1`** → The only valid strings are `"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"`.
- **`n = 10` (max limit)** → Ensure efficient generation and ordering.

## How to Run
Compile and run the Java code:
```sh
javac Solution.java
java Solution
```

Or use it within a main function and call `getHappyString(n, k)` with desired inputs.
