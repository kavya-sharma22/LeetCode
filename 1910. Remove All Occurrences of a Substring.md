# Remove All Occurrences of a Substring (LeetCode 1910)

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `part`, perform the following operation on `s` until all occurrences of the substring `part` are removed:

- Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring `part` and remove it from `s`.
- Return `s` after removing all occurrences of `part`.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
```

**Output:**

```
"dab"
```

**Explanation:**
- Remove "abc" starting at index 2, so `s = "dabaabcbc"`.
- Remove "abc" starting at index 4, so `s = "dababc"`.
- Remove "abc" starting at index 3, so `s = "dab"`.
- Now, `s` has no occurrences of "abc".

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"
```

**Output:**

```
"ab"
```

**Explanation:**
- Remove "xy" starting at index 4, so `s = "axxxyyyb"`.
- Remove "xy" starting at index 3, so `s = "axxyyb"`.
- Remove "xy" starting at index 2, so `s = "axyb"`.
- Remove "xy" starting at index 1, so `s = "ab"`.
- Now, `s` has no occurrences of "xy".

## Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using a simple iterative approach with the `String.contains()` method.

### Key Observations:
1. As long as the string `s` contains `part`, we need to remove its leftmost occurrence.
2. We can use `s.indexOf(part)` to find the leftmost index where `part` occurs.
3. Use `substring()` to remove the `part` and concatenate the remaining parts of the string.
4. Repeat the process until no more occurrences of `part` exist in `s`.

### Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeOccurrences(String s, String part) {
        // Continue removing occurrences of 'part' as long as it exists in 's'
        while (s.contains(part)) {
            // Find the index of the leftmost occurrence of 'part'
            int partStartIndex = s.indexOf(part);

            // Remove the substring 'part' from 's'
            s = s.substring(0, partStartIndex) + s.substring(partStartIndex + part.length());
        }
        // Return the updated string after all occurrences are removed
        return s;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)` where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `part`. In the worst case, we may have to scan and modify `s` multiple times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we only modify the input string and do not use extra space.

---

This approach efficiently removes all occurrences of the substring `part` from `s` while maintaining optimal performance.
