###### Divide Array Into Equal Pairs

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `2 * n` integers. You need to divide `nums` into `n` pairs such that: 

- Each element belongs to exactly one pair.
- The elements present in a pair are equal.

Return `true` if `nums` can be divided into `n` pairs, otherwise return `false`.

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]`  
**Output:**  
`true`  
**Explanation:**
There are 6 elements in `nums`, so they should be divided into `6 / 2 = 3` pairs. The pairs can be `(2, 2)`, `(3, 3)`, and `(2, 2)`, which satisfies all conditions.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`nums = [1,2,3,4]`  
**Output:**  
`false`  
**Explanation:**
There is no way to divide `nums` into `4 / 2 = 2` pairs such that the pairs satisfy every condition.

## Solution

### Java Implementation
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public boolean divideArray(int[] nums) {
        // Sort array to group equal elements together
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Check consecutive pairs in sorted array
        for (int pos = 0; pos < nums.length; pos += 2) {
            // If any pair doesn't match, we can't form n equal pairs
            if (nums[pos] != nums[pos + 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // All pairs found successfully
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Sorting the array**: `O(n log n)` (where `n = nums.length`)
- **Iterating through the array**: `O(n)` (checking consecutive pairs)
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(n log n)`, as sorting dominates the runtime complexity.

## Explanation
1. **Sorting Step**: Sorting ensures that all equal elements appear together, making it easier to form pairs.
2. **Pair Validation**: By iterating through the sorted array in steps of 2, we can verify whether each adjacent pair consists of equal numbers.
3. **Efficiency**: Sorting is the most expensive operation, making the time complexity `O(n log n)`, while the iteration step runs in `O(n)` time.

### Space Complexity: `O(1)`
- The solution sorts the input array in-place, requiring only constant extra space.

## Notes
- This solution efficiently checks for valid pairs using sorting and a single pass through the array.
- Alternative approaches could use a **hashmap** to count occurrences (`O(n) time, O(n) space`).
- This approach is optimal in terms of space efficiency.
