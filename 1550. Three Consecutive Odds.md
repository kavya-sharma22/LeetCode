# LeetCode - 1550. Three Consecutive Odds

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are **three consecutive odd numbers** in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
Output: true
Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odd numbers.
```

## Constraints

* `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

---

## Approach

We iterate through the array from the beginning to the third-to-last element and check for each triplet whether all three numbers are odd. If such a triplet is found, we immediately return `true`. If the loop completes without finding such a triplet, we return `false`.

### Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 2; i++) {
            if (arr[i] % 2 == 1 && arr[i + 1] % 2 == 1 && arr[i + 2] % 2 == 1) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  We iterate over the array once, stopping at `n - 2`, where `n` is the length of the array. Each iteration performs constant-time operations.

* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  No additional space is used except for a few variables for iteration and computation.

## Summary

This problem is a straightforward sliding window check for a specific pattern (three consecutive odd numbers). It demonstrates a basic application of condition checking within a loop and has optimal linear time performance.
