##### 🔢 Leetcode 3375: Minimum Operations to Make Array Values Equal to K (Java Solution)

## 📘 Problem Description
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

An integer `h` is called **valid** if all values in the array that are strictly greater than `h` are **identical**.

You are allowed to perform the following operation:
- Choose a valid integer `h`.
- For all `i` such that `nums[i] > h`, set `nums[i] = h`.

Return the **minimum number of operations** required to make all elements equal to `k`. If impossible, return `-1`.

---

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1
```java
Input: nums = [5,2,5,4,5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Perform operations with valid integers 4 and then 2.
```

### Example 2
```java
Input: nums = [2,1,2], k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: Since 1 < 2, we can never reach k = 2 for all elements.
```

### Example 3
```java
Input: nums = [9,7,5,3], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Valid operations: 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1
```

## ✅ Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= 100`

---

## 💡 Approach

We iterate through the array:
- If any number is less than `k`, it's **impossible** to make all values `k`, so return `-1`.
- If any number is **greater than** `k`, we add it to a `Set`.
- The minimum number of operations equals the number of **unique values greater than `k`**.

This works because each operation can bring **one unique value greater than `k`** down to `k`.

## 🧠 Java Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        Set<Integer> st = new HashSet<>();
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (x < k) {
                return -1;
            } else if (x > k) {
                st.add(x);
            }
        }
        return st.size();
    }
}
```

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git
cd leetcode-solutions
```

### 2. Compile the Java Code
```bash
javac Solution.java
```

### 3. Run the Program
Create a `Main.java` file to call and test `minOperations()`.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {5,2,5,4,5};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.minOperations(nums, k));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```
