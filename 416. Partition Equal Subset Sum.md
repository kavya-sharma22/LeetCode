#### 🧩 Leetcode 416: Partition Equal Subset Sum (Java Solution)

## 📘 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the **sum of the elements in both subsets is equal**, or `false` otherwise.

### ✅ Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

---

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1:
```java
Input: nums = [1, 5, 11, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned into [1, 5, 5] and [11]
```

### Example 2:
```java
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```

## 💡 Approach

This is a variation of the **Subset Sum Problem**, which can be solved using **Dynamic Programming**.

We check if there exists a subset with sum equal to half of the total sum. If the total sum is odd, return `false` immediately.

## 🧠 Java Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            total += num;
        }

        if (total % 2 != 0) {
            return false;
        }

        int target = total / 2;
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[target + 1];
        dp[0] = true;

        for (int num : nums) {
            for (int i = target; i >= num; i--) {
                dp[i] = dp[i] || dp[i - num];
            }
        }

        return dp[target];
    }
}
```

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

1. Copy the Java solution into a file named `Solution.java`.
2. Compile the file using:
```bash
javac Solution.java
```
3. Create a main method or test using your preferred IDE or CLI to call `canPartition()`.
