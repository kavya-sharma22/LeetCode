# 1128. Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs

## Problem Statement

Given a list of dominoes, where each domino is represented as a pair `[a, b]`, two dominoes are considered equivalent if either:

* `a == c` and `b == d`, or
* `a == d` and `b == c`

That is, one domino can be rotated to equal the other.

You need to return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that:

* `0 <= i < j < dominoes.length`
* `dominoes[i]` is equivalent to `dominoes[j]`

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 3
```

### Constraints

* `1 <= dominoes.length <= 4 * 10^4`
* `dominoes[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= dominoes[i][j] <= 9`

---

## Solution

The key idea is to treat each domino `[a, b]` as a normalized form where the smaller value comes first. This makes `[1,2]` and `[2,1]` both become `12`. We use a fixed-size array of size 100 (since max possible unique normalized values are `1-9` for both a and b), where `num[val]` stores how many times we have seen the normalized value `val`. For every such value already seen, we can form that many pairs.

### Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int numEquivDominoPairs(int[][] dominoes) {
        int[] num = new int[100];
        int ret = 0;
        for (int[] domino : dominoes) {
            int val = domino[0] < domino[1]
                ? domino[0] * 10 + domino[1]
                : domino[1] * 10 + domino[0];
            ret += num[val];
            num[val]++;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of dominoes
* **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we only use a fixed-size array of 100

## Summary

This solution efficiently counts equivalent domino pairs by normalizing each domino and using a hash-like structure (array index) to track previously seen normalized values.
