# Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid

## Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer grid of size `m x n` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can add `x` to or subtract `x` from any element in the grid.

A **uni-value grid** is a grid where all the elements are equal.

Return the **minimum number of operations** to make the grid a uni-value grid. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

## Example

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```java
grid = [[2,4],[6,8]], x = 2
```
**Output:**
```java
4
```
**Explanation:**
We can make every element equal to 4 by performing the following operations:
- Add `x` to `2` once.
- Subtract `x` from `6` once.
- Subtract `x` from `8` twice.
A total of 4 operations were performed.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```java
grid = [[1,5],[2,3]], x = 1
```
**Output:**
```java
5
```
**Explanation:**
We can make every element equal to `3`.

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```java
grid = [[1,2],[3,4]], x = 2
```
**Output:**
```java
-1
```
**Explanation:**
It is impossible to make every element equal.

## Constraints
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= x, grid[i][j] <= 10^4`

## Solution Approach

### Steps:
1. **Flatten the Grid**: Convert the 2D grid into a 1D list.
2. **Sort the List**: This helps in efficiently determining the median.
3. **Find the Median**: The median is the optimal value that minimizes the number of operations required.
4. **Check for Validity**: Ensure that all elements share the same remainder when divided by `x`, otherwise return `-1`.
5. **Calculate Operations**: Sum up the operations needed to convert each element to the median.

### Code Implementation (Java)
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[][] grid, int x) {
        // Create a list to store all the numbers from the grid
        ArrayList<Integer> numsArray = new ArrayList<>();
        int result = 0;

        // Flatten the grid into numsArray
        for (int[] row : grid) {
            for (int num : row) {
                numsArray.add(num);
            }
        }

        // Sort numsArray in non-decreasing order to easily find the median
        Collections.sort(numsArray);

        int length = numsArray.size();
        // Store the median element as the final common value
        int finalCommonNumber = numsArray.get(length / 2);

        // Iterate through each number in numsArray
        for (int number : numsArray) {
            // If the remainder when divided by x is different, return -1
            if (number % x != finalCommonNumber % x) {
                return -1;
            }
            // Add the number of operations required to make the current number equal to finalCommonNumber
            result += Math.abs(finalCommonNumber - number) / x;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: **O(m * n log(m * n))**
- **Flattening the grid:** `O(m * n)`
- **Sorting the list:** `O(m * n log(m * n))`
- **Iterating through the list:** `O(m * n)`
- **Overall Complexity:** **O(m * n log(m * n))** (due to sorting)

### Space Complexity: **O(m * n)**
- **Storing the list:** `O(m * n)`
- **Sorting operations:** `O(1)` additional space (since sorting is in-place)

---

## Edge Cases Considered
- All elements are already equal â†’ `0` operations needed.
- Impossible case where elements do not have a uniform remainder when divided by `x`.
- Large values of `m` and `n` to check performance.
- Cases where the median is already present in the grid.

---

## Summary
This problem is efficiently solved using sorting and median-based optimization. The core idea is that the median minimizes the sum of absolute differences, making it the best choice for the target value in a uni-value grid transformation.
