## LeetCode Solutions
I enjoy solving coding problems on platforms like LeetCode. Here's a recent solution I implemented for the problem **"Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I"**:

### Problem Statement
You are given a binary array `nums`.

You can do the following operation on the array any number of times (possibly zero):
- Choose any 3 consecutive elements from the array and flip all of them.
- Flipping an element means changing its value from `0` to `1`, and from `1` to `0`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in `nums` equal to `1`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

#### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0]`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:**
We can do the following operations:
1. Choose the elements at indices `[0, 1, 2]`. The resulting array is `nums = [1,0,0,1,0,0]`.
2. Choose the elements at indices `[1, 2, 3]`. The resulting array is `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0]`.
3. Choose the elements at indices `[3, 4, 5]`. The resulting array is `nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1]`.

#### Example 2:
**Input:** `nums = [0,1,1,1]`

**Output:** `-1`

**Explanation:**
It is impossible to make all elements equal to `1`.

#### Constraints:
- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1`

### Solution in Java
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        Deque<Integer> flipQueue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            while (!flipQueue.isEmpty() && i > flipQueue.peekFirst() + 2) {
                flipQueue.pollFirst();
            }

            if ((nums[i] + flipQueue.size()) % 2 == 0) {
                if (i + 2 >= nums.length) {
                    return -1;
                }
                count++;
                flipQueue.offerLast(i);
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We iterate through the array once, and each index is processed in constant time due to the deque operations.
  - The `while` loop removes elements from the queue in amortized \(O(1)\) time.
  - Hence, the overall time complexity is linear.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - In the worst case, the deque could store up to \(O(n)\) elements if flips are required frequently.
  - Thus, the auxiliary space usage is proportional to the input size.
