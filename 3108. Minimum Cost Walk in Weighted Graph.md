##### Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph

## Problem Statement
There is an **undirected weighted graph** with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given:
- An integer `n` representing the number of vertices.
- An array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between vertices `ui` and `vi` with a weight of `wi`.
- A 2D array `query`, where `query[i] = [si, ti]`. For each query, you need to find the **minimum cost** of a walk starting at vertex `si` and ending at vertex `ti`.

### Walk Definition
A **walk** on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk:
- Starts and ends at a vertex.
- Can visit the same vertex or edge multiple times.
- Must have each edge connecting the preceding and following vertex.

### Walk Cost Calculation
The **cost** of a walk starting at node `u` and ending at node `v` is defined as the **bitwise AND** of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. If the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is `[w0, w1, w2, ..., wk]`, then the cost is calculated as:

```
w0 & w1 & w2 & ... & wk
```
where `&` denotes the **bitwise AND operator**.

### Task
For each query `[si, ti]`, return the **minimum cost** of a walk between `si` and `ti`. If there exists **no such walk**, return `-1`.

## Solution Approach
The solution is implemented in Java using the **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)** data structure. The key steps include:

1. **Union-Find Data Structure:**
   - Each node starts as its own component.
   - The `find` function uses path compression to optimize lookup times.
   - The `union` function merges two components, using union by rank to keep the tree balanced.

2. **Component Cost Calculation:**
   - Initially, all nodes are in their own component.
   - As edges are added, components are merged.
   - The component cost is computed using bitwise AND of all edge weights in the component.

3. **Answering Queries Efficiently:**
   - If two nodes belong to different components, return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, return the precomputed bitwise AND cost of their component.

## Code Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    int[] parent;
    int[] depth;

    public int[] minimumCost(int n, int[][] edges, int[][] queries) {
        parent = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = -1;
        
        depth = new int[n];
        int[] componentCost = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            componentCost[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            union(edge[0], edge[1]);
        }

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int root = find(edge[0]);
            componentCost[root] &= edge[2];
        }

        int[] answer = new int[queries.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int start = queries[i][0];
            int end = queries[i][1];
            
            if (find(start) != find(end)) {
                answer[i] = -1;
            } else {
                int root = find(start);
                answer[i] = componentCost[root];
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }

    private int find(int node) {
        if (parent[node] == -1) return node;
        return parent[node] = find(parent[node]);
    }

    private void union(int node1, int node2) {
        int root1 = find(node1);
        int root2 = find(node2);
        
        if (root1 == root2) return;
        
        if (depth[root1] < depth[root2]) {
            int temp = root1;
            root1 = root2;
            root2 = temp;
        }
        
        parent[root2] = root1;
        
        if (depth[root1] == depth[root2]) {
            depth[root1]++;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Union-Find Operations (Path Compression + Union by Rank):** ~`O(Î±(n))` (inverse Ackermann function, nearly constant time)
- **Processing Edges:** `O(m)` (where `m` is the number of edges)
- **Answering Queries:** `O(q)` (where `q` is the number of queries)
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(m + q)`

## Example Usage
### Input:
```java
n = 5;
edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]];
queries = [[0,3],[3,4]];
```

### Output:
```java
[1, -1]
```

## Constraints
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- `0 <= wi <= 10^5`
- `1 <= query.length <= 10^5`
- `query[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= si, ti <= n - 1`
- `si != ti`

## Summary
- Efficiently finds minimum cost walks using **Union-Find**.
- Precomputes costs for quick query resolution.
- Handles large inputs effectively.
