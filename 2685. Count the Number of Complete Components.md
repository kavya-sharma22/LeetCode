# 2685. Count the Number of Complete Components

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. There is an undirected graph with `n` vertices, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices `a_i` and `b_i`.

Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.

A **connected component** is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

A connected component is said to be **complete** if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.

### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i <= n - 1`
- `a_i != b_i`
- There are no repeated edges.

## Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int countCompleteComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Adjacency lists for each vertex
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        // Map to store frequency of each unique adjacency list
        Map<List<Integer>, Integer> componentFreq = new HashMap<>();

        // Initialize adjacency lists with self-loops
        for (int vertex = 0; vertex < n; vertex++) {
            graph[vertex] = new ArrayList<>();
            graph[vertex].add(vertex);
        }

        // Build adjacency lists from edges
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }

        // Count frequency of each unique adjacency pattern
        for (int vertex = 0; vertex < n; vertex++) {
            List<Integer> neighbors = graph[vertex];
            Collections.sort(neighbors);
            componentFreq.put(
                neighbors,
                componentFreq.getOrDefault(neighbors, 0) + 1
            );
        }

        // Count complete components where size equals frequency
        int completeCount = 0;
        for (Map.Entry<List<Integer>, Integer> entry : componentFreq.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getKey().size() == entry.getValue()) {
                completeCount++;
            }
        }

        return completeCount;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Building the adjacency list**: `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the number of vertices and `m` is the number of edges.
- **Sorting adjacency lists**: Since each vertex list is sorted, this takes at worst `O(n log n)`, where `n` is small (≤ 50).
- **HashMap operations**: Each adjacency list is stored in a HashMap, with insert and lookup operations taking `O(1)` on average.
- **Final traversal to count complete components**: `O(n)`.

### Overall Complexity: **O(n^2 log n)** in the worst case, which is efficient for `n ≤ 50`.
