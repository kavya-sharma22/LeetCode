#### Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies

## Problem Statement
You have information about `n` different recipes. You are given a string array `recipes` and a 2D string array `ingredients`. The `i`-th recipe has the name `recipes[i]`, and you can create it if you have all the needed ingredients from `ingredients[i]`. A recipe can also be an ingredient for other recipes, i.e., `ingredients[i]` may contain a string that is in `recipes`.

You are also given a string array `supplies` containing all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.

Return a list of all the recipes that you can create. You may return the answer in any order.

**Note:** Two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.

### Example 1:
#### Input:
```java
recipes = ["bread"]
ingredients = [["yeast","flour"]]
supplies = ["yeast","flour","corn"]
```
#### Output:
```java
["bread"]
```
#### Explanation:
We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".

---

### Example 2:
#### Input:
```java
recipes = ["bread","sandwich"]
ingredients = [["yeast","flour"],["bread","meat"]]
supplies = ["yeast","flour","meat"]
```
#### Output:
```java
["bread","sandwich"]
```
#### Explanation:
We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
We can create "sandwich" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredient "bread".

---

### Example 3:
#### Input:
```java
recipes = ["bread","sandwich","burger"]
ingredients = [["yeast","flour"],["bread","meat"],["sandwich","meat","bread"]]
supplies = ["yeast","flour","meat"]
```
#### Output:
```java
["bread","sandwich","burger"]
```
#### Explanation:
We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
We can create "sandwich" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredient "bread".
We can create "burger" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredients "bread" and "sandwich".

## Constraints:
- `n == recipes.length == ingredients.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= ingredients[i].length, supplies.length <= 100`
- `1 <= recipes[i].length, ingredients[i][j].length, supplies[k].length <= 10`
- `recipes[i]`, `ingredients[i][j]`, and `supplies[k]` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- All the values of `recipes` and `supplies` combined are unique.
- Each `ingredients[i]` does not contain any duplicate values.

## Solution Approach
This problem can be solved using a **Topological Sorting (Kahn's Algorithm) approach** or **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** since recipes depend on other ingredients, forming a directed dependency graph.

### Algorithm:
1. Store all initial `supplies` in a **set** to track available ingredients.
2. Maintain a **queue** of recipe indices.
3. Iterate through the queue and check if a recipe can be made using only available ingredients.
4. If possible, add the recipe to the `available` set and move to the next recipe.
5. Continue until no new recipes can be created.

### Complexity Analysis
#### **Time Complexity: O(n * m)**
- `n` is the number of recipes, and `m` is the average number of ingredients per recipe.
- Each recipe is checked at most once, and each ingredient is checked within that loop, leading to `O(n * m)` complexity.

#### **Space Complexity: O(n + m)**
- The **set** stores all available supplies and created recipes, contributing to `O(n) + O(m)`.
- The **queue** holds recipes that are being processed, contributing to `O(n)`.
- Overall, `O(n + m)` space is required.

## Java Implementation
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> findAllRecipes(
        String[] recipes,
        List<List<String>> ingredients,
        String[] supplies
    ) {
        // Track available ingredients and recipes
        Set<String> available = new HashSet<>();
        for (String supply : supplies) {
            available.add(supply);
        }

        // Queue to process recipe indices
        Queue<Integer> recipeQueue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int idx = 0; idx < recipes.length; ++idx) {
            recipeQueue.offer(idx);
        }

        List<String> createdRecipes = new ArrayList<>();
        int lastSize = -1;

        // Continue while we keep finding new recipes
        while (available.size() > lastSize) {
            lastSize = available.size();
            int queueSize = recipeQueue.size();

            // Process all recipes in current queue
            while (queueSize-- > 0) {
                int recipeIdx = recipeQueue.poll();
                boolean canCreate = true;

                // Check if all ingredients are available
                for (String ingredient : ingredients.get(recipeIdx)) {
                    if (!available.contains(ingredient)) {
                        canCreate = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }

                if (!canCreate) {
                    recipeQueue.offer(recipeIdx);
                } else {
                    // Recipe can be created - add to available items
                    available.add(recipes[recipeIdx]);
                    createdRecipes.add(recipes[recipeIdx]);
                }
            }
        }

        return createdRecipes;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
This solution efficiently determines all possible recipes that can be created using a **BFS approach with a queue**. The time complexity remains manageable for the given constraints, making it a practical approach for solving the problem.
