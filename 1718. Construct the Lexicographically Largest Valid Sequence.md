## Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence (LeetCode 1718) 

## Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

1. The integer `1` occurs once in the sequence.
2. Each integer between `2` and `n` occurs twice in the sequence.
3. For every integer `i` between `2` and `n`, the distance between the two occurrences of `i` is exactly `i`.
4. The sequence should be lexicographically largest.

It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
```java
n = 3
```
**Output:**  
```java
[3,1,2,3,2]
```
**Explanation:**  
`[2,3,2,1,3]` is also a valid sequence, but `[3,1,2,3,2]` is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
```java 
n = 5
```
**Output:**  
```java
[5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 20`

## Solution Approach
The problem is solved using **backtracking** to generate the lexicographically largest sequence. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialize a sequence** of size `2*n - 1` filled with zeros.
2. **Use a boolean array** to keep track of numbers that have already been placed.
3. **Start recursive backtracking** from index `0`.
4. **Place numbers from `n` to `1`** to ensure lexicographically largest order.
5. **Follow constraints** where:
   - `1` is placed once.
   - For numbers `>= 2`, place them at `index` and `index + num` if both positions are free.
6. **Backtrack** when an invalid state is reached and try the next possibility.

## Implementation (Java)
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] constructDistancedSequence(int targetNumber) {
        int[] resultSequence = new int[targetNumber * 2 - 1];
        boolean[] isNumberUsed = new boolean[targetNumber + 1];
        
        findLexicographicallyLargestSequence(0, resultSequence, isNumberUsed, targetNumber);
        return resultSequence;
    }

    private boolean findLexicographicallyLargestSequence(int currentIndex, int[] resultSequence, boolean[] isNumberUsed, int targetNumber) {
        if (currentIndex == resultSequence.length) {
            return true;
        }
        if (resultSequence[currentIndex] != 0) {
            return findLexicographicallyLargestSequence(currentIndex + 1, resultSequence, isNumberUsed, targetNumber);
        }

        for (int numberToPlace = targetNumber; numberToPlace >= 1; numberToPlace--) {
            if (isNumberUsed[numberToPlace]) continue;

            isNumberUsed[numberToPlace] = true;
            resultSequence[currentIndex] = numberToPlace;

            if (numberToPlace == 1 || (currentIndex + numberToPlace < resultSequence.length && resultSequence[currentIndex + numberToPlace] == 0)) {
                if (numberToPlace != 1) {
                    resultSequence[currentIndex + numberToPlace] = numberToPlace;
                }

                if (findLexicographicallyLargestSequence(currentIndex + 1, resultSequence, isNumberUsed, targetNumber)) {
                    return true;
                }
                
                if (numberToPlace != 1) {
                    resultSequence[currentIndex + numberToPlace] = 0;
                }
            }
            
            resultSequence[currentIndex] = 0;
            isNumberUsed[numberToPlace] = false;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n!)` (worst case, since backtracking explores all possibilities)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (due to recursion stack and boolean array for tracking used numbers)

---

## How to Run
1. Copy the Java code into a new file (`Solution.java`).
2. Compile and run the program with test cases.
