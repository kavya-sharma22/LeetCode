# Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children

## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `candies`, where each element represents a pile of candies of size `candies[i]`. You can divide each pile into any number of sub-piles, but you cannot merge two piles together.

You are also given an integer `k`, representing the number of children. The goal is to allocate piles of candies to `k` children such that each child gets the same number of candies. Each child can only be allocated candies from one pile, and some piles may remain unused.

Return the maximum number of candies each child can receive.

## Example
### Example 1:
**Input:**
```java
candies = [5,8,6], k = 3
```
**Output:**
```java
5
```
**Explanation:**
- We divide candies[1] (8) into two piles of 5 and 3, and candies[2] (6) into two piles of 5 and 1.
- Now, we have five piles: [5, 5, 3, 5, 1].
- We allocate three piles of size 5 to three children.
- It is not possible for each child to receive more than 5 candies.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```java
candies = [2,5], k = 11
```
**Output:**
```java
0
```
**Explanation:**
- There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total.
- It is impossible to allocate at least 1 candy to each child.
- Hence, each child gets no candies.

## Approach
The problem is solved using **Binary Search**:
1. Find the maximum candies in any pile.
2. Perform binary search between 0 and the maximum pile size.
3. Check if it's possible to allocate at least `middle` candies per child using helper function `canAllocateCandies`.
4. If possible, search for a larger possible allocation; otherwise, search for a smaller one.
5. Return the maximum number of candies that can be allocated per child.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search:** The search range is from `1` to `max(candies)`, so it takes **O(log max(candies))** iterations.
- **Checking Allocation Feasibility:** Each iteration checks all piles, which takes **O(n)**.
- **Total Complexity:** O(n log max(candies)), where `n` is the number of piles.

### Space Complexity
- **O(1)** as only a few extra variables are used.

## Code Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumCandies(int[] candies, long k) {
        int maxCandiesInPile = 0;
        for (int candy : candies) {
            maxCandiesInPile = Math.max(maxCandiesInPile, candy);
        }

        int left = 0, right = maxCandiesInPile;
        while (left < right) {
            int middle = (left + right + 1) / 2;
            if (canAllocateCandies(candies, k, middle)) {
                left = middle;
            } else {
                right = middle - 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }

    private boolean canAllocateCandies(int[] candies, long k, int numOfCandies) {
        long maxNumOfChildren = 0;
        for (int candy : candies) {
            maxNumOfChildren += candy / numOfCandies;
        }
        return maxNumOfChildren >= k;
    }
}
```

## Summary
- **Approach:** Binary Search
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log max(candies))
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Efficiently finds the maximum candies that can be given to each child**
