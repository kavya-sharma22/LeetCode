# Zero Array Transformation II (LeetCode 3356)

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a 2D array `queries` where `queries[i] = [li, ri, vali]`.

Each `queries[i]` represents the following action on `nums`:
- Decrement the value at each index in the range `[li, ri]` in `nums` by at most `vali`.
- The amount by which each value is decremented can be chosen independently for each index.

A **Zero Array** is an array with all its elements equal to `0`.

Return the **minimum possible non-negative value** of `k`, such that after processing the first `k` queries in sequence, `nums` becomes a Zero Array. If no such `k` exists, return `-1`.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [2,0,2], queries = [[0,2,1],[0,2,1],[1,1,3]]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
2
```
**Explanation:**
- After processing the first query, `nums` becomes `[1,0,1]`.
- After processing the second query, `nums` becomes `[0,0,0]`.
- The minimum `k` that makes `nums` a Zero Array is `2`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3,2],[0,2,1]]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
-1
```
**Explanation:**
- After processing all queries, `nums` is `[3,0,0,0]`, which is not a Zero Array.

## Solution Approach

The solution employs **binary search** to find the minimum number of queries (`k`) required to turn `nums` into a Zero Array.

1. **Binary Search**: We perform a binary search over `k` (the number of queries processed), from `0` to `queries.length`.
2. **Difference Array**: We use a difference array to efficiently apply range decrement operations.
3. **Prefix Sum Check**: After applying the first `k` queries, we check if every element of `nums` can be reduced to `0`.

### Implementation Details:
- The `currentIndexZero()` function simulates the effect of the first `k` queries using a **difference array** to efficiently process range updates.
- If `nums` can be reduced to zero within `k` queries, we reduce `right` in the binary search; otherwise, we increase `left`.

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:**
- **Binary Search:** `O(log M)`, where `M = queries.length`.
- **Processing Queries:** `O(N + K)`, where `N = nums.length` and `K = queries.length` (difference array approach ensures efficient updates).
- **Total Complexity:** `O(N log M + K log M)`, which is efficient for large constraints.

### **Space Complexity:**
- **Difference Array:** `O(N)`.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(N)`, since the difference array is the only extra space used.

## Code Implementation (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minZeroArray(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int n = nums.length, left = 0, right = queries.length;

        // Zero array isn't formed after all queries are processed
        if (!currentIndexZero(nums, queries, right)) return -1;

        // Binary Search
        while (left <= right) {
            int middle = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (currentIndexZero(nums, queries, middle)) {
                right = middle - 1;
            } else {
                left = middle + 1;
            }
        }

        // Return earliest query that zero array can be formed
        return left;
    }

    private boolean currentIndexZero(int[] nums, int[][] queries, int k) {
        int n = nums.length, sum = 0;
        int[] differenceArray = new int[n + 1];

        // Process queries
        for (int queryIndex = 0; queryIndex < k; queryIndex++) {
            int left = queries[queryIndex][0], right = queries[queryIndex][1], val = queries[queryIndex][2];
            differenceArray[left] += val;
            differenceArray[right + 1] -= val;
        }

        // Check if zero array can be formed
        for (int numIndex = 0; numIndex < n; numIndex++) {
            sum += differenceArray[numIndex];
            if (sum < nums[numIndex]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
