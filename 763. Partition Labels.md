# Partition Labels (Leetcode 763)

## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. The concatenation of all parts should result in `s`.

**Example 1:**
```java
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
Each letter appears in at most one part.
```

**Example 2:**
```java
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
```

## Solution Approach
1. **Determine the last occurrence** of each character in the string and store it in an array.
2. **Iterate through the string**, keeping track of the farthest last occurrence of characters seen so far.
3. **When the current index reaches the farthest occurrence of a character**, we determine the end of a partition.
4. **Store the size of the partition** and start a new partition.

## Code Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String s) {
        // Stores the last index of each character in 's'
        int[] lastOccurrence = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            lastOccurrence[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;
        }

        int partitionEnd = 0, partitionStart = 0;
        List<Integer> partitionSizes = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            partitionEnd = Math.max(
                partitionEnd,
                lastOccurrence[s.charAt(i) - 'a']
            );
            // End of the current partition
            if (i == partitionEnd) {
                partitionSizes.add(i - partitionStart + 1);
                partitionStart = i + 1;
            }
        }
        return partitionSizes;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string, since we traverse the string twice.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we use only a fixed-size array and a few variables.
